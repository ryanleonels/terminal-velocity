"Terminal Velocity", a community incremental game by @randomtuba and team

[Original project description follows]

**Welcome to Terminal Velocity**

In Terminal Velocity, you produce speed with Accelerators. Each Accelerator produces a power that translates to a multiplier, so the multipliers stack to give the overall production.

So, where's the "community" part of this? Well, there will be 3 prestige layers in this game. We start at the 1st prestige layer, and we'll move on to the next one once it's finished. For each prestige layer, each developer codes one mechanic, and *each mechanic has to have some strategic element*.

Whether it's a split path, some customization, or a limited number of purchases, there are a lot of possibilities. While this game is focused on being the ultimate strategy incremental (without relying too much on guides), I am allowing one or two linear mechanics as well (such as a new type of Accelerator), as sometimes strategic elements can ruin a mechanic overall.

Now to answer some questions:

**How can I join?**

If you can code in JavaScript and I can trust you working on the game, you're in!...unless the developer cap has been reached, which is 8 (including me). This is because a large number of developers has been the cause of the abandonment of many community incrementals in the past.

**What IDE are we using?**

I really want to get this debate settled with from the get go, so we're using Glitch. That's it. It's unfortunate that it doesn't have autocorrect, but it's the easiest in terms of multi-user collaboration.

**Are we using Vue?**

It depends on popular opinion. I would personally prefer using Vue, but we'll see what the majority thinks.

**How long will this last?**

Until it's done.

**Can I leave the project?**

Absolutely! It's totally fine to code a mechanic for a layer and leave afterwards. If you leave, there's another slot that would open up for someone new to work on the game.

**What are the rules?**

1. Be nice
2. No news ticker
3. No glyphs
4. Have fun!
